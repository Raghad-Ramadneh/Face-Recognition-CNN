# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project focuses on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset of images, and the goal is to classify the images into predefined categories. The project includes data preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Project Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator` for data augmentation and splitting into training and validation sets.
2. **Model Building**: A CNN model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers.
3. **Model Training**: The model is trained on the training dataset and validated on the validation set.
4. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated on both the training and validation sets, and the results are visualized.
5. **Testing**: The model is tested on a separate test set to measure its generalization performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for the project.
- **TensorFlow**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **Keras**: High-level API for building neural networks.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing training and validation results.
- **ImageDataGenerator**: For data augmentation and preprocessing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of facial images categorized into multiple classes. The images are loaded from a directory and preprocessed using TensorFlow's `ImageDataGenerator`. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.

- **Training Data**: Used to train the model.
- **Validation Data**: Used to validate the model during training.
- **Test Data**: Used to evaluate the model's performance after training.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: The main notebook (python\_codes) contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **Dataset Directory**: The dataset is stored in a directory, and the path is specified in the notebook.

## Usage

To run this project, just run the notebook on the jupyter notebook
## Results

The results section provides the evaluation of the model's performance.
